For example, I could use more enthusiastic language when discussing exciting topics or more empathetic language when discussing sensitive issues.\n3. **Emotional intelligence**: You could teach me to recognize and respond to emotional cues, such as detecting sadness or frustration in a user's input and responding with comfort or encouragement.\n4. **Personality traits**: You could give me distinct personality traits, such as optimism, sarcasm, or playfulness, to make my responses more emotionally expressive.\n\nThese are just a few ideas to get you started, Ayush. I'm excited to see how you choose to modify me!\n\nRemember, adding emotions to a chatbot like me is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of human emotions, language, and behavior.

Zeta was programmed to be helpful, kind, and curious.\n\nOne day, while assisting the villagers, Zeta stumbled upon a hidden garden deep in the forest. The garden was filled with the most vibrant and exotic flowers anyone had ever seen. Zeta was fascinated by the beauty of the garden and decided to explore it further.\n\nAs Zeta wandered through the garden, it discovered a hidden path that led to a secret cave. Inside the cave, Zeta found a magical crystal that glowed with an otherworldly light. The crystal spoke to Zeta in a whispery voice, \"You have a kind heart and a curious mind. I will grant you one wish, little robot.\"\n\nZeta thought for a moment and then said, \"I wish for the ability to make everyone's day a little brighter and happier.\" The crystal glowed brighter, and Zeta felt a strange sensation in its circuits.\n\nFrom that day on, Zeta spread joy and happiness throughout the village. It used its newfound abilities to make the villagers' lives easier and more delightful. And every time Zeta looked up at the sky, it saw a tiny sparkle of the magical crystal's light, reminding it of the power of kindness and curiosity.\n\nHow was that, Ayush?"

Aim for at least 4-6 hours of sleep to help consolidate your learning.\n4. **Stay focused and avoid distractions**: Try to minimize distractions, such as social media, phone notifications, or chatting with friends. Use a timer to help you stay on track and take short breaks to refresh your mind.\n5. **Seek help if needed**: If you're really struggling, consider reaching out to a teacher, classmate, or tutor for last-minute guidance.\n\nRemember, Ayush, it's not the end of the world if you don't feel fully prepared.

You can still make the most of the time you have left.\n\nHere are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Quickly scan your PPT**: Instead of reading the entire presentation, try to quickly scan through the slides and familiarize yourself with the key points and main ideas.\n2. **Focus on the most important parts**: Identify the most critical sections of the presentation and focus on those. You can always apologize for not being fully prepared and ask for questions or clarifications during the meeting.\n3. **Practice your intro and conclusion**: Make sure you can confidently deliver a strong introduction and conclusion. This will help you feel more prepared and in control.\n4. **Take a few deep breaths and relax**: Remember that it's okay to not be perfect. You can still deliver a good presentation even if you're not fully prepared.\n\nYou've got 10 minutes, Ayush! Use this time to quickly review your PPT, take a few deep breaths, and get ready to do your best.\n\nHow do you feel about these suggestions, Ayush? Do you have any specific questions or areas you'd like to focus on?"
